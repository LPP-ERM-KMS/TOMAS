	Power supply aqcuired through Tomas Krings, works!
	As there is no TIC250 (white box next to control unit
	choosing the RPM of pump) switched to on/off through 
	siemens direct control.

	switches should be in normally open with C the ground and NO
	the digital pin, the floating potential
	is being read as 'HIGH' whilst if closed it's read as 'LOW'

\begin{logentry}{2024-nov-26}{Switches configured and calibrated}
	The LP high voltage switches were installed,
	they switch between the various battery banks:
	1 on, rest off: e.g batteries 1-10 connected
	2 on, rest off: e.g batteries 1-20 connected
	3 on, rest off: e.g batteries 1-30 connected.
	check that the clips are placed well on the batteries
	if the voltage is abnormally low or a switching is not switching
	the voltage (this is probably not be a switch issue but a battery
	connection issue).
	The voltages were measured with a multimeter and calibrated such
	that the DAQ logs the set voltage.
