\section{Usage Guide}
TOMAS is a tokamak-like structure and has watercooled magnets and watercooled pumps, the watercooling of which need to be enabled manually. Upon entering (from the parking side) the facility the various water cooling pumps
can be found in the leftmost corner, these are enabled by opening the connected hoses, pushing the lever up and clicking the green button (as should be shown in some figure here).

After enabling cooling check the various pressure gauges to see if vacuum is reached (shown in figures ...). We'd then like to inject gas (to form a plasma), this is done via cannisters connected on the left side (from the parking) via various 
pipes to the machine, these need to be emptied first
